# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### RAG System Enhancement - Phase 2
We are implementing Phase 2 of the RAG system enhancement, focusing on improved context selection and serialization:

1. **Intent Analysis & Context Selection (In Progress)**
   - Implemented configurable intent analysis system
   - Added smart context selection based on intent
   - Created JSON-based configuration for selection rules
   - Added support for different types of context (metrics, changes, domain knowledge)

2. **Serialization Issues (Resolved)**
   - Added to_dict methods to data models for JSON serialization
   - Updated repository methods to return serializable dictionaries
   - Fixed datetime serialization in metric history
   - Updated UI components to handle dictionary data:
     * Modified dashboard.py to use dictionary access
     * Updated search.py to handle nested dictionary structures
     * Fixed impact_analysis.py to work with serialized data
     * Updated analyzer.py to consistently use dictionary access
   - Implemented consistent dictionary handling throughout:
     * Proper conversion of objects to dictionaries
     * Consistent datetime handling between ISO strings and objects
     * Fixed variable shadowing issues
     * Ensured proper handling of nested data structures

3. **Next Steps**
   - Add validation for serialized data structures
   - Implement caching for serialized data
   - Add error handling for malformed data
   - Consider performance optimizations

   - Relevance ranking of context elements
   - Dynamic context window management

4. **Multi-hop Reasoning (Future)**
   - Enabling complex query resolution through multiple retrieval steps
   - Connecting information across different parts of the knowledge base
   - Supporting follow-up questions with maintained context

5. **Contextual Memory (Future)**
   - Maintaining context across interactions
   - Intelligent context accumulation and pruning
   - Optimizing token usage

6. **Self-Reflection and Verification (Future)**
   - Implementing verification mechanisms
   - Fact checking against knowledge base
   - Response refinement for improved accuracy

### Previous Work: Code Reorganization
We have recently completed a major reorganization of the codebase to improve modularity and maintainability:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Moved data models to src/data/models.py
   - Created dedicated repository in src/data/repository.py
   - Isolated sample data generation in src/data/sample_generator.py

2. **RAG System**
   - Split into modular components:
     - Core RAG functionality
     - Indexing strategies
     - Domain knowledge management
     - Analysis capabilities

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Moved LLM service to dedicated module
   - Organized prompts into structured categories
   - Prepared for multi-provider support

4. **UI Layer**
