# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### RAG System Enhancement
We have completed Phase 1 of the RAG system enhancement, implementing a new embedding system that provides more comprehensive context and improved search capabilities:

1. **Advanced Embedding System (Completed)**
   - Implemented configurable embedding model interface using sentence-transformers
   - Created efficient vector storage with similarity search
   - Built hybrid retrieval combining semantic and keyword search
   - Added smart text processing and chunking
   - Provided example implementation in src/rag/embeddings/

The new system features:
- Easy configuration for different embedding providers (prepared for future Snowflake integration)
- Adjustable weights between semantic and keyword search
- Intelligent text chunking with overlap
- Metadata filtering support
- Efficient in-memory vector storage

Next Focus:

2. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (Upcoming)**
   - Building a knowledge graph for changes, metrics, and domain concepts
   - Automatic relationship extraction
   - Enabling graph traversal for comprehensive context
   - Supporting causal analysis

3. **Advanced Context Selection (Next Phase)**
   - Implementing sophisticated intent analysis
   - Smart context selection based on query and intent
   - Relevance ranking of context elements
   - Dynamic context window management

4. **Multi-hop Reasoning (Future)**
   - Enabling complex query resolution through multiple retrieval steps
   - Connecting information across different parts of the knowledge base
   - Supporting follow-up questions with maintained context

5. **Contextual Memory (Future)**
   - Maintaining context across interactions
   - Intelligent context accumulation and pruning
   - Optimizing token usage

6. **Self-Reflection and Verification (Future)**
   - Implementing verification mechanisms
   - Fact checking against knowledge base
   - Response refinement for improved accuracy

### Previous Work: Code Reorganization
We have recently completed a major reorganization of the codebase to improve modularity and maintainability:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Moved data models to src/data/models.py
   - Created dedicated repository in src/data/repository.py
   - Isolated sample data generation in src/data/sample_generator.py

2. **RAG System**
   - Split into modular components:
     - Core RAG functionality
     - Indexing strategies
     - Domain knowledge management
     - Analysis capabilities

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Moved LLM service to dedicated module
   - Organized prompts into structured categories
   - Prepared for multi-provider support

4. **UI Layer**
   - Split UI into modular pages
   - Created reusable components
   - Improved state management

## Recent Changes

### 1. Directory Structure
```
src/
├── data/           # Data layer components
├── rag/            # RAG system modules
├── llm/            # LLM integration
├── ui/             # UI components
└── evaluators/     # Future evaluators
```

### 2. Component Separation
- Separated monolithic RAG system into focused modules
- Moved UI code into dedicated pages
- Organized prompts by functionality
- Created clear component boundaries

### 3. Documentation
- Created comprehensive Memory Bank
- Documented system architecture
- Captured technical context
- Preserved product context
